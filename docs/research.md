## Chaos as a Software Product Line <br/> A platform for improving open hybrid-cloud systems resiliency

#### Status: Submitted to Transactions on cloud computing 'Under review'
{: .no_toc }

Nowadays, cloud-native software architectures have a significant relevance due to the speed and agility they provide.
These properties lead relevant organizations in different industries, like video streaming (Netflix), car-sharing (Uber, Cabify), banking
(BBVA, HSBC), and governmental agencies (NASA, FBI, CERN, ESA) to heavily rely on cloud-native software to run their business-critical
applications. Additionally, including fault injection actions in the production infrastructure allows companies to have consistent
environments, to improve applications dependability against unexpected failures, to provide better user experience, and to improve the
overall system quality. Thus, cloud computing technologies allow development teams to rapidly create complex systems and to deploy
them continuously, at a global scale.

This work describes a novel fault injection platform, represented as a Software Product Line, to analyze the effects caused by a wide
spectrum of adverse conditions. This software platform is designed to be executed on top of cloud-native environments, either in private
or public clouds. The proposed architecture shows a novel way for representing feature models based on UML component diagrams.
Furthermore, we present a thorough empirical study carried out in real-world environments, providing promising results.
