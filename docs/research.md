### Chaos as a Software Product Line <br/> A platform for improving open hybrid-cloud systems resiliency

#### Status: Submitted to Transactions on cloud computing 'Under review'
{: .no_toc }

Nowadays, cloud-native software architectures have a significant relevance due to the speed and agility they provide.
These properties lead relevant organizations in different industries, like video streaming (Netflix), car-sharing (Uber, Cabify), banking
(BBVA, HSBC), and governmental agencies (NASA, FBI, CERN, ESA) to heavily rely on cloud-native software to run their business-critical
applications. Additionally, including fault injection actions in the production infrastructure allows companies to have consistent
environments, to improve applications dependability against unexpected failures, to provide better user experience, and to improve the
overall system quality. Thus, cloud computing technologies allow development teams to rapidly create complex systems and to deploy
them continuously, at a global scale.

This work describes a novel fault injection platform, represented as a Software Product Line, to analyze the effects caused by a wide
spectrum of adverse conditions. This software platform is designed to be executed on top of cloud-native environments, either in private
or public clouds. The proposed architecture shows a novel way for representing feature models based on UML component diagrams.
Furthermore, we present a thorough empirical study carried out in real-world environments, providing promising results.

## Research interests

* Study how fault injection actions affect the system behavior deployed over large-scale cluster configurations.
* Stablish relationships between the injected faults, the size of the system and the impact on the system performance.
* Study the behavior of cloud-native systems with low latency requirements (for instance IoT and TelCo use cases), service mesh and software-defined networking applications, and edge architectures.
* Study backup, restore, and disaster recovery mechanisms after executing the fault injection actions. In this way, it is possible to recover the cluster consistent state in a shorter period of time and guarantee a reduction of the fault injection actions impact.
* Investigate different real-world applications to generate different workloads to be processed by the system, like cpu-intensive or data-intensive applications, produce different results when the fault actions are executed.
