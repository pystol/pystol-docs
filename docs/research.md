## Research interests
{: .no_toc }

* Study how fault injection actions affect the system behavior deployed over large-scale cluster configurations.
* Stablish relationships between the injected faults, the size of the system and the impact on the system performance.
* Study the behavior of cloud-native systems with low latency requirements (for instance IoT and TelCo use cases), service mesh and software-defined networking applications, and edge architectures.
* Study backup, restore, and disaster recovery mechanisms after executing the fault injection actions. In this way, it is possible to recover the cluster consistent state in a shorter period of time and guarantee a reduction of the fault injection actions impact.
* Investigate different real-world applications to generate different workloads to be processed by the system, like cpu-intensive or data-intensive applications, produce different results when the fault actions are executed.
* Improve the observability of the system when fault injection actions are executed.
